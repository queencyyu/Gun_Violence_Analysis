# Introduction and Overview

Gun violence is a critical public issue in the United States, posing significant challenges to the communities. Understanding the patterns and trends of gun violence incidents is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive overview of gun violence incidents across the US from 2013 to 2018, utilising detailed data on occurrences, fatalities, and the demographics of those involved.

# Data Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle. The data was originally downloaded from Gun Violence Archieve (GVA), a not for profit corporation which is formed in 2013 to provide free online public access to accurate information about gun-related violence in the United States. 
The data comes in CSV file which contains data for all recorded gun violence incidents in US between January 2013 and March 2018. 

# Analysis Questions
1. Are there any seasonal patterns in gun violence incidents? How has the frequency change changed over time? 
2. Which states have the highest and the lowest counts of gun violence incidents? 
3. Which age group are normally involved with gun violence incidents? 
4. Are there differences in gender representation among victims and suspects? 
5. What types of events are most frequently associated with gun violence incidents?

# Data Limitations
While the gun violence dataset from Gun Violence Archive (GVA) provides a valuable resource for studying gun-related incidents in the United States, it also has several limitations that should be considered when analysing the data. The dataset may not capture all gun violence incidents due to underreporting or incomplete reporting. Not all incidents are reported to law enforcement agencies, and some incidents may not be included in the dataset if they were not documented by official sources. The dataset may also be biased towards certain types of gun violence incidents or those that receive more media attention. Incidents that result in fatalities or mass shootings, for example, may be overrepresented compared to other types of incidents. Additionally, the distribution of incidents may be biased towards certain geographic regions or areas with better reporting infrastructure. Lastly, the dataset covers a specific time period (January 2013 to March 2018) and may not reflect current trends or patterns in gun violence.
